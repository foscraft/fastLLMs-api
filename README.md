### fastLLMsAPI

#### Introduction
This project is about building an API using FastAPI, which allows users to have text-based conversations with a Language Model. It is built on GPT4All and Langchain. Useres can interact with  Language Models, like LLama2, GPT-3, and can generate human-like text based on the input provided, making it an interesting tool for various applications, including chatbots.

#### Query own data
It also allows users to query their own data by first creating embeddings by running the..
```bash
python3 ingest.py
```
To generate embeddings.

#### Technologies Used
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- Language Model (e.g., GPT-3): Used to generate responses to user queries.
- Python: The programming language used for the development.

### FastAPI Chatbot API with Language Models



#### Features

### Ask Question -1

- Endpoint: `/api/v1/ask`
- Method: `POST`
- Description: Submit a query and receive an answer from the language model chain.
- Request Body:
  - Form Data Parameters:
    - `query` (string): The query or question to ask the model.
- Response:
  - Content Type: `application/json`
  - Body:
    - `answer` (string): The answer generated by the language model chain.
    - `documents` (array): An array of documents related to the answer.
    - `query_time` (float): The time taken to process the query in seconds.
